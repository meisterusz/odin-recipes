        <h2><i>What is this dish?</i></h2>
        <p>This is a wonderful berry crisp. I use a triple berry mixture of raspberries, blackberries, and blueberries, but just one works well too! My family loves it! Serve it with whipped cream and it looks great.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 ½ cups fresh blackberries</li>
            <li>1 ½ cups fresh raspberries</li>
            <li>1 ½ cups fresh blueberries</li>
            <li>4 tablespoons white sugar</li>
            <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>2 cups rolled oats</li>
            <li>1 ½ cups packed brown sugar</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon ground nutmeg</li>
            <li>1 ½ cups butter</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
            <li>In a large bowl, gently toss together blackberries, raspberries, blueberries, and white sugar; set aside.</li>
            <li>In a separate large bowl, combine flour, oats, brown sugar, cinnamon, and nutmeg. Cut in butter until crumbly. Press half of mixture in the bottom of a 9x13 inch pan. Cover with berries. Sprinkle remaining crumble mixture over the berries.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 30 to 40 minutes, or until fruit is bubbly and topping is golden brown.</li>
        </ol>
